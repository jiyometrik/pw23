\section{Introduction and Rationale}
After the Singapore government relaxed travel restrictions due to COVID-19,
there has been a recent increase in the number of tourists travelling in and out of Singapore.
As such, hotels have seen a rise in the number of prospective tourists to be housed,
and this may encourage an increase in the number of reviews hotels may receive.

Today, it is common to use social networks, messengers, and review websites
to receive data from customer opinions. This is especially true for hotels,
where previous occupants may evaluate the hotel on several factors through their
reviews --- be it cleanliness, facilities, location and convenience, etc.
These come in two forms --- a quantitative review (based on stars, diamonds, hearts, etc.)
and a more qualitative review through text.

However, quantitative reviews do not always paint the full picture of customers'
opinions towards a certain hotel. Though it is certainly helpful to have a more
objective rating system using numerical scores, eg. the Department of Tourism grading system in
the Philippines, or the European Hotelstars Union system,
these are given by customers subjectively and do not reflect the reasons for customers giving the rating.
There is also evidence of manipulation of ratings by hotel management itself, where hotels may be
compelled to forge positive or negative ratings to bias the overall rating.
This made up $2.1\%$ of the $66$ million reviews submitted to TripAdvisor (TripAdvisor, 2019). % cite here!
Therefore, we propose using sentiment analysis to extract customers' true feedback on hotels instead.
